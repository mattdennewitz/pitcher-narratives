# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Reports must read like a scout wrote them -- surfacing changes, adaptations, and execution trends rather than reciting numbers.
**Current focus:** Phase 22 — context-assembly-prompt-rendering

## Current Position

Phase: 22
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 22
Last activity: 2026-04-03

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- v1.7: Per-season baseline grouping (not cross-season averaged) -- foundation for v1.8
- v1.7: load_pitcher_data() filters baselines to max season -- v1.8 Phase 19 removes this filter

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- pitchingplus model internals at ~/src/pitchingplus/packages/plus -- external dependency, changes there affect this project's data pipeline
- Only 2 years of data exist (2025 parquet may not exist on all machines) -- tests must use synthetic multi-year data
